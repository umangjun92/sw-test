# Path Exclusion in Service Worker

## About this repo

It was generated by:

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app --template pwa-typescript
```

Contains two routes:

- `Home`: index.
- `NotFound`: catch-all 404.

The nginx configuration is located in `.nginx/nginx.conf`. It contains two routes:

- `/business-cards`: proxies all requests to https://marketing.vahak.in/business-cards.
- `/`: catch-all that serves React's build directory.

## Start the server

To try out how this works, use Docker Compose:

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
```

## TODO

Although `/business-cards` is working, it is responding with 404. This is
because the request is being made to http server not httpS server. For the
latter, SSL needs to be set up, which is a complicated task in local
environments.
